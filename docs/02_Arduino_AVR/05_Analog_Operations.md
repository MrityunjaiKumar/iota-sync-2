## What are Analog signals?

![](img\lecture6A_pg3.JPG)

An Analog signal is a time varying signals which can take any value between a specific range and is defined at each point of time.

## What are digital signals?

Digital signals are the signals which have a finite set of possible values and they cannot take any other value.

## What is ADC?

It stands for **Analog to Digital Converter**

## Analog to Digital converter(ADC)

Way to convert an analog value to a digital value in Arduino, If logic is 5V level

 5   ------> 1023
 1   ------> 1023 / 5

 3   ------> (1023/5)*3 = 614

## Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)

As it's obvious from the name, LDR or a photoresistor is a resistor which changes its resistance value depending upon the intensity of light which falls on it.

## POTENTIOMETER

A potentiometer is a three terminal device with which enables us to vary the resistance to make a voltage divider.

## NTC Thermistors

A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance depends upon the temperature of the environment it is kept in. NTC is acronym for “Negative Temperature Coefficient”. Thus, NTC Thermistor is a device whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature.
